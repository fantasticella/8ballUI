    <p> Hi. My name is Ellalaine, <br> <br>
        but you can call me Ella for short. <br> <br> My love for coding began In 2009 when I used to 
       <br> <br> casually code Tumblr themes. <br> <br> Little did I know, that was the start of my journey. <br> <br>
        For me, then, it was just a way to fangirl. <br> <br> (I can tell you more about that, if you'd like) <br> <br>
        I'm going to be graduating in 2023 with my <br> <br> Bachelor of Science in Software Development. <br> <br>
        When I'm not coding or designing, <br> <br>
        I like to read and take pictures of nature. </p>
